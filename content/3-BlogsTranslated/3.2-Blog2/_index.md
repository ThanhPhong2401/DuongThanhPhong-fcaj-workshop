## Why I wrote this post

While exploring AI services on AWS, I regularly read the AWS Machine Learning Blog to learn about new technologies. The Claude Apps Gateway article helped me understand that enterprise AI is not only about choosing a powerful model. Organizations also need centralized identity management, access control, policy enforcement, telemetry, routing, and cost governance.

I wrote this post to summarize the key ideas from the article and relate them to the AWS infrastructure services I learned during my internship.

## My first impression

At first, I thought Claude Apps Gateway was simply a tool for connecting Claude with AWS.

After reading the article, I realized that it is actually a self-hosted control plane that helps organizations centrally manage Claude Code and Claude Desktop.

In large organizations, providing credentials for every developer, distributing configuration files, and tracking AI usage individually can become difficult. Claude Apps Gateway solves this problem by providing a centralized management layer.


## What does Claude Apps Gateway provide?

Claude Apps Gateway sits between users and the AI service. Every request passes through the Gateway before reaching either Amazon Bedrock or Claude Platform on AWS.

Its primary responsibilities include:

### Identity

- Enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) using OIDC.
- Short-lived authentication sessions.
- No long-lived credentials stored on developers' computers.

### Policy

- Centralized control over model permissions.
- Tool permissions.
- Default configuration settings.
- Policies can be applied to different identity-provider groups.

### Telemetry

- Usage data is collected through OTLP.
- Metrics can be exported to Amazon CloudWatch.
- Integration with Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus.

### Routing

- Requests can be routed to Amazon Bedrock.
- Or routed to Claude Platform on AWS.
- Supports multi-Region and multi-account architectures.

### Spend Caps

- Daily limits.
- Weekly limits.
- Monthly limits.
- Limits can be configured for organizations, teams, or individual users.

To me, Claude Apps Gateway plays a role similar to Amazon API Gateway, but for enterprise AI applications instead of APIs.


## Deployment and sign-in

The Gateway runs as a stateless container and can be deployed on:

- Amazon ECS
- Amazon EKS
- Amazon EC2

Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL stores temporary authentication information and rate-limit counters.

To secure access, organizations can use:

- Internal Application Load Balancer
- AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)

Configuration is stored in a YAML file, while secrets remain in environment variables.

When using Amazon Bedrock, the container can authenticate using its IAM Role instead of static credentials.

Developers authenticate by running:

```bash
claude /login
```

After signing in through the organization's Single Sign-On system, they can continue using Claude Code normally. Every request is automatically authenticated, logged, and governed according to centralized policies.


## What I learned

The biggest lesson I learned from this article is that deploying AI in an enterprise environment involves much more than selecting an AI model.

As AI adoption increases, organizations must also manage:

- User identities
- Security policies
- Monitoring and observability
- Cost management
- Request routing
- Governance

During my AWS internship, I mainly worked with infrastructure services such as Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, AWS Backup, and AWS Storage Gateway.

This article expanded my perspective by showing that production AI systems also require a centralized control plane responsible for authentication, authorization, monitoring, routing, and budgeting.

The article also explains two deployment options:

- **Amazon Bedrock** is suitable when organizations want data to remain entirely within the AWS security boundary.
- **Claude Platform on AWS** provides the native Claude experience while still using AWS authentication and billing.


## Conclusion

For me, *Introducing Claude Apps Gateway for AWS* is much more than a product announcement.

It demonstrates how enterprises can deploy AI applications safely while maintaining centralized identity management, policy enforcement, telemetry, routing, and cost governance.

As AI becomes increasingly integrated into enterprise systems, these operational capabilities will become just as important as the AI models themselves.
